# grade-growth-calculator
A simple Python program to calculate growth of a student’s grade over a specific number of school years based on an initial grade and a grade increase rate. It provides the grade growth and the final after the specified number of years.
#Grade Growth Calculator 
This is a python script that calculates the growth of a student’s grade over a number of school years, based on an initial grade and a grade increase rate.

## Usage
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone or download this repository.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script by executing the following command: ‘python. grade_growth_calculater.py’.
Follow the prompts to enter the initial grade, grade increase rate (in percentage), and the number of the school years.
The script will calculate the grade growth and display the result.

## Example
Enter the initial grade: 85
Enter the grade increase rate (in percentage) : 5
Enter the number of school years: 4
Grade growth: 18.31803125000002
Final grade: 103.31803125000002

## How it Works
The ‘calculate_grade_growth’ function takes in the initial grade, grade increase rate, and the number of school years as parameters. It calculates the final grade by applying the grade increase rate to the initial grade over the specified number of school years. The function then calculates the grade growth by subtracting the initial grade from the final grade. The grade growth value is returned by the function. 

The main part of the script prompts the user for input,  calls the ‘calculate_grade_growth’ function, and displays the grade growth and the final grade. 

Feel free to modify the script or use it as a starting point for your own project.
